Mad Libs
A mad lib is a word game where you take a short story (usually only a paragraph long) and remove several wordsfrom it and replace them with alternative words with matching grammatical structure. The fun comes from thefact that the replacement words are provided by somebody who has not yet read the story, and so once the storyis re-composed, it becomes silly and non-sensical.
For example, if you have the sentence:
Johnny went to the store to get some milk.
You might remove the following three words: "Johnny", "store", "milk".
Johnny
is a proper noun,
store
is a place,and
milk
is a thing. The sentence with words removed becomes:
__________ went to the _________ to get some ________.
You would then ask your friend to provide alternatives for these words by only telling him or her the type of wordyou are looking for. You might say: "give me a proper noun" and he or she would give you the first name thatcomes to mind: "Sam". The you might say "give me a place" and he or she might say "The Grand Canyon". Finallyyou would ask "give me a thing" and he or she might say "lawnmower".
You then re-compose the story by injecting the words provided by your friend. Our hypothetical mad libbecomes:
Sam went to the Grand Canyon to get a lawnmower.
Project Requirements
1.
Find a mad lib online, in a book, or write one yourself. You need to have at least
10
replacement words.
2.
Reproduce the mad lib game with a program which plays the role of the story editor.
1.
The program will ask a series of questions at the console and the user of the program will providethe answers to those questions.
2.
Finally the program will print out the full mad lib with the input words replaced into the story
For example:
Give me a proper noun: Sam
Give me a place: Grand Canyon
Give me a thing: Lawnmower
Sam went to the Grand Canyon to get a Lawnmower.
